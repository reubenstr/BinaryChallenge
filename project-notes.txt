3D PRINTING:
Most parts can be printed with PLA or ABS at 0.2mm layer height, 20% infill.
The frame needs to be scaled to compensate for plastic shrink.
Success was found using Hatchbox PLA by scaling the STL by 100.35% in the slicer. 

CREATE IMAGE FOR TFT LCD:
Create a 320px by 240px image in any graphics software.
Suggested (free, online): https://www.photopea.com/
Use LCD Image Converter to convert the image (.PNG) into a byte array.

See logo.h header comments for program settings.

ALTERNATIVE MCU:
The ESP32 was selected for 3.3v logic levels required by the TFT LCD
and quick spin up time. Wi-Fi may be nice if adding multiplayer support.
A cost effective option (untested) is using a STM32 (Blue Pill).
A RPI2040 was tested, but at the time of the test the Arduino framework
did not appear to fully suppor the RPI2040 and caused compilation issues.
An Arduino Nano (ATmega328) does not have the correct logic levels nor 
is there enough memory to support the splash screen logo and extra fonts.
